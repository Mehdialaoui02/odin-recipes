    <p>Learn how to make French fries that are super crispy with this twice-fried method. 
        I don't think most people realize that any decent French fry needs to be fried twice. 
        The first frying is done at a lower temperature, which softens the potato 
        and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification. </h4>
        <h4>Ingredients :</h4>
        <ul>
        <li> 1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips </li>
        <li> 2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed </li>
        <li> salt to taste </li>
        </ul>      
    </p>

    <h4> How to Make french fries Step-By-Step </h4>
    <p>
        Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade french fries:
    <ol>
        <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely. </li>
        <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
    </ol>
